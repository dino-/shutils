# shutils


## Synopsis

A collection of utilities for scripting and working in a shell


## Description

Utilities to assist with scripting and working in a shell. Utilities include lambda.

### lambda

Wraps a shell command in a lambda function to allow easier manipulation of the
argument list. This is useful when you need to repeatedly modify an argument
buried in middle of a long command, or perform flip-like manipulations to
reorder the arguments to a command.
